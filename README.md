## Business Problem

### Story:  
Part of our company, the online shop Twentytems, is experiencing a decline in completed purchases. Despite launching several new online marketing campaigns, the conversion rate continues to decrease. The marketing department is reaching out to us for assistance in conducting a detailed analysis to identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies.

### Key Points:  
Lower Conversion Rates: A smaller portion of site visitors are completing purchases.
Reduced Customer Engagement: Interactions with the website and marketing materials have decreased.
Importance of Customer Feedback Analysis: Gaining insight into customer views on products and services is essential to boost engagement and conversions.
High Marketing Costs: Considerable spending on marketing efforts isn’t achieving the anticipated results.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  

Conversion Rate: The proportion of website visitors who complete a purchase.
Customer Engagement Rate: Level of interaction with marketing content (clicks, likes, comments).
Customer Feedback Score: The average rating derived from customer reviews.
